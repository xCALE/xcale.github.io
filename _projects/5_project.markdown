This WP will be devoted to test field experiments. At every iteration, results analysis will be shared among projectâ€™s partners. Use cases & specification updates and the next iteration planning will be established collaboratively with all partners,
## Task 5.1: Experimentation setup.
Definition of experimental protocols and related specific tools will be defined, according to iteration objectives. Success indicator: qualitative measure protocols available to confirm quantitative measurements
## Task 5.2: Experimentation on test fields.
Measurement protocols will be conducted on defined test fields. related data will be collected and analysed. Success Indicator: Sufficient data available.
## Task 5.3: Use cases & specifications updates.
According to experimental results, and other WPs progress, use cases specifications for next iterations will be updated. Success indicators: WPs progress monitored and acknowledged. Partners consensus on roadmap.
